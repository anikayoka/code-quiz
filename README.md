# Quiz Challenge

## Purpose
To build an application that tests users knowledge of JavaScript, in a timed quiz format

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Web APIs

## Issues
This project was quite the challenge. JavaScript has not been easy for me to grasp as was HTML & CSS. APIs is another extension of JavaScript so this too was not the easiest project for me to tackle.

I got it done, but not without the stresses that come along with learning something new and having to work on it with little to no assistance. I got it done, thanks to helpful tutors, TAs and fellow students.
